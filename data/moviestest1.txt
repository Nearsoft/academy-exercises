review/summary: "There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle"
review/text: Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the "Wounds of Christ" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).

review/summary: Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production
review/text: THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.<br /><br />Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talanc&oacute;n), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a 'church' where she becomes a 'saint' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela's life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.<br /><br />The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talanc&oacute;n, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.  Grady Harp, June 07

review/summary: This movie needed to be made.
review/text: The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

review/summary: distantly based on a real tragedy
review/text: THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ (2006)<br />directed by Kevin James Dobson<br />approx. 1 hour 25 minutes<br /><br />The town of Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.  It is home to several factories owned by American companies who employ Mexicans at very low wages.  Since the early 1990s, Juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women.  There is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer.  It has also been suggested that due to the local police department's failure to solve the crimes, new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught.  The situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdrop.<br /><br />We start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in Juarez.  Then we meet the hard-headed American journalist played by Minnie Driver.  She aggressively questions the local police and befriends a Catholic priest.  Within the first twenty minutes or so, we see the terrifying reality of the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />At this point, the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie.  A woman named Mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital.  While the priest is speaking to her, she lets out a howl... and her hands begin bleeding*.  This "stigmata" is meant to show that she has been blessed by the Virgin Mary.  Our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done.  Meanwhile Mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following, eventually landing her own radio show (!) and living under the protection of gang members, whom she refers to as "modern warriors".  The only thing missing is "Jes&uacute;s Malverde".<br /><br />Now I understand that we don't know everything about the Juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to "fill in the blanks" when crafting an exciting dramatization.  However if you are going to deviate so far from the true story, then don't preface your movie as being "based on the ongoing unsolved murders in Cuidad Juarez".  There is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the REAL stories of Juarez and there is no need to fabricate.  This movie may "raise the issue" of the Juarez women, but it isn't really about them at all!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the killings in Juarez, there are a few documentaries.  A recent one from Las Perlas Del Mar Films is simply titled 'JUAREZ' and is a good introduction.  Zulma Aguiar's 'JUAREZ MOTHERS FIGHT FEMICIDE' (focuses on the families) is also easy to find.  There is another one which I haven't seen titled 'BORDER ECHOES'.<br /><br />*- note to Hollywood:<br />the nails that crucified Jesus were through his wrists, not his palms!

review/summary: "What's going on down in Juarez and shining a light on it"
review/text: Informationally, this SHOWTIME original is essential viewing for enlightening audiences on the dangerous plight of women migrant workers from Los Angeles who are routinely and mysteriously murdered on the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas.Since 1993, hundreds of woman have turned up dead and mutilated and no one seems to either care or have an answer. The fear and death continue.<br /><br />Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon's screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez.Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.<br /><br />Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.

review/summary: A  Rock N Roll History Lesson
review/text: Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.

review/summary: A  MUST-HAVE  video if you grew up in the 50's or 60's
review/text: I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.

review/summary: I expected more.
review/text: I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages.

review/summary: Another outstanding performance and concert.
review/text: As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy's Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let's Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.

review/summary: Outstanding Whether It Is Either On VHS Or DVD
review/text: I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.

review/summary: Spectacular and suspenseful family film!
review/text: The cover of our DVD of "Far From Home" says in large letters: "Family Feature".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named "Yellow".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.<br /><br />Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, "Far From Home" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.<br /><br />Although the movie is "clean", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY

review/summary: Awesome Dog Movie
review/text: You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.

review/summary: A movie for all ages
review/text: You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ZXSI">A Walk in the Clouds</a>.

review/summary: uh oh
review/text: I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br />Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.

review/summary: Dog Lover's Will Adore This
review/text: Are you a dog lover and into adventure? Then Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog, is the movie for you! This movie tells the story of a young boy named Angus who adopts a stray dog and names him Yellow. Angus, his father, and Yellow set sail one day, but a huge storm causes their boat to topple. Rescue teams are only able to find Angus' father. Stranded on an island far from civilization, Angus and Yellow's survival skills are put to the test. Will they get rescued? Watch this movie to find out! I liked this movie because it is a heartwarming tale. The movie builds anticipation in the rescue team's pursuit to find Angus and Yellow. I was especially impressed with Yellow's acting! His facial expressions and actions resemble that of a person's. I recommend this film for children ages 7 and up. The movie is an uplifting journey and is a splendid family film. Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog is one of the many classics brought to your home by HDnet movies on KidScene, a morning and Friday night programming block specifically for kids and families.

In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films.

review/summary: A Boy and His Dog Fight to Survive
review/text: Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, young Angus McCormick (Jesse Bradford) has learned many survival skills.  He's just finishing up a nice canoe.  And when he finds a stray dog, he adopts him and names him Yellow.<br /><br />Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad, John (Bruce Davison), on a supply run seems like a dream come true.  But when they encounter a fierce storm, the boat they are in capsizes.  John is quickly rescued, but the search and rescue teams can't find any trace of Angus or Yellow.<br /><br />The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?<br /><br />This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.<br /><br />The film could have been much better but does grow on you.  Don't rush out to see it, but there's no reason to avoid it either.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.

review/summary: Truly bad but not the worst
review/text: This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn't good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. "Far From Home" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole "romance" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it.

review/summary: A Lavish Chinese Production That Ends Up Being A Soapy (And Pretty Loopy) Revenge Drama
review/text: I had heard a lot of criticism leveled at Gao Xiaosong's "My Kingdom" complaining that its two disparate halves never really fit together into a cohesive narrative. The first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the Chinese opera (not the singing kind). One of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge. The three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a Southern rival. The movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular Shanghai opera scene in the twenties. After this simple story is resolved, the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy. The screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed, implausibilities mount up, and characters have their ulterior motives exposed. It is chaotic (and tries way too hard), but at least it's fun.<br /><br />Many who have unfavorably judged "My Kingdom" tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link. I, however, tend to disagree. I thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that I never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot. Heck, two seconds after the boys arrive in Shanghai, they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously. Hey, that was simple. These two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel. Hey, that was simple too. Now they are legends! Wow, that's a lot for their first day in town! After the duel, the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady. As one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair, the other seeks to avenge his family's murder from so many years ago. The remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real. But as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself, I must admit to being amused by it all. It, for me, was far more entertaining than what had preceded it.<br /><br />The movie itself is elaborately staged. The battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing over-the-top quality. 1920's Shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable. However, it all feels a little flat. The leads are attractive enough, but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic. I understand they are known pop stars in their country, and that makes sense. The actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like he's about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene. Ultimately, I think "My Kingdom" tries to accomplish too much. I personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain. As is, it's a bit of a mess. I probably liked it for the wrong reasons, but its loopiness is not without its charms. KGHarris, 1/12.

review/text: Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.  &quot;She Keep On Coming&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; rock the house, while &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing, &quot;Woman In Love&quot;, but &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot; is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work.<p>This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.  &quot;One Night Only&quot; is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation.

As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their "One Night Only" concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.

review/summary: bee gees fans enjoy
review/text: This is a fine performance by the Bee Gees who perform "by request", probably the most difficult format for live performers.  They play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted.  Still an enjoyable performance.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I have been a Bee Gees fan for years.  It is really wonderful to see them again.  I love the songs from the new album &quot;This is Where I In&quot;.  It is really great to hear Maurice take the lead in two of the songs, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air&quot;.  While Barry and Robin have beautiful voices, I really enjoy listening to Maurice sing. After all these years, it is really great to see and hear the joy they still get from their music and from preforming together.<br />While precious minutes of the show were taken up with requests, it was still nice to see their interaction with the fans.  I think anyone who is a fan of Barry, Robin and Maurice will enjoy this video.  I have watched it over and over.  It is really sad that we won't have the chance to see the three of them together like this again.

review/summary: HOPE
review/text: Although this movie is broke up into two different parts, it was very good.  Since the movie was done in two parts, the second one repeats a lot as if one was not there to view the first part.  I did not like that at all.  The point to this movie is really good.  I'm actually going to send it to someone that has held "life" against God.  This is an excellent ministering tool!!

review/summary: Finding Hope in the face of loss
review/text: This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith. It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here --- they are still with us in spirit. It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God's love. Louie Giglio is a Christian who's spirit sends a loving message from his heart.

review/summary: Very inspiring!  Great for teenagers and young adults.
review/text: The whole Passion Series is life changing, a must have for any Christian household that has teenagers and young adults.  Louie has wonderful approach to teaching about the magnificence of God, the Creater of Heaven and Earth!  My  16 year old niece was so impressed and awe-struck after viewing "How Great is Our God" and "Indescribable" that she ended up taking the whole series home with her to share with all her friends.  Needless to say, I let her keep them and purchased a new series for myself. I am going to be showing my Bible study group "How Great is Our God" tonight as we have a skeptic in our group.  I know this video will dispel any doubts she may have about God!  The "Hope" video is equally inspiring in a different way, more focused on real life rather than creation.  It is a compliment to the "Fruitcake and Ice Cream" video which deals with a real life story of a young college student who comes to know Christ.

review/summary: Terrific DVD for anyone suffering
review/text: This DVD is the third in the Passion 2006 series done by Louie Giglio.  The four videos go in order, so it is helpful to see them in order to follow the story throughout all of them.  However, having said that, this is still a very moving presentation about pain, suffering, and hope.  I would recommend this for high school and older, for Christians and non-Christians.<br /><br />You can watch this with someone who is suffering, and no one has to say a word at the end.  It is not intrusive or offensive, but is comforting because it is about the God who is truly big enough to comfort anyone in the worst circumstances in life.  And everyone experiences them at some point.  With this Hope presentation, and with all of them in the series, you definitely will sense that God does the supernatural "heavy lifting" that no human possibly can.<br /><br />Excellent for mentoring teens and older.  The audience in the video is largely college age.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Wow.............
review/text: This is an awesome addition to your movie collection!... A great tool to use to witness to others. All four are great and I think that you need all four. We own all four and even our children are interested in the series. They even repeat things that are stated in the serious. We are all amazed at the topics and images. You will have to see this for yourself. If you have viewed any of the others, Hope is a must view as well. There really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing Hope. Also there is no statement that can tell you the experience of owning all four to share with others. You never know when you may encounter someone who may need what is in this series and you to can use this series to win souls, and bring someone out of the darkness and into the light.<br /><br />Our souls have truly been blessed by this series... we plan to bless others when they visit us with this series. Go ahead and Bless yourself, family, and friends with this awesome series, make sure you get all four and view them all. We tried to view them in the order that they are listed inside of the dvd. I don't know if it matters, as it is just what we did. Now we are waiting on the Blind side to come out.. Enjoy! You won't be the same! A treat for the whole family, friends, church family, and the neighborhood! Don't forget the popcorn! We use the crazy popcorn popper it is awesome with movies or without!<br /><br />This is one series that we are glad we did not pass by... all cultures will and should enjoy this!<br /><br />Always watch what you do and say to others as you never know what they are going through, or the impact you will have on them, and you never know who you are entertaining.<br /><br />Keep up the Good Work Louie Giglio!

Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out (although too brief for me) in historically correct detail.<br />Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas' book, the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits.

review/summary: One of the best adventure movies ever
review/text: Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on, use a great director, pick great locations, assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors, and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay, and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be.  Adventure, mystery, romance, action sequences, character and plot development, and humor are all combined into a masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1,000 page book by Dumas is, of course, a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like.  The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways.  Incredibly, the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending.  I can't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel.  The screenplay is perfectly balanced.  If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark, the action so blurred, the characters so poorly developed, and the plot so weak that you aren't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen, you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand.<br /><br />The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn.  Caviezel just couldn't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life.  Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune, played by the late Richard Harris, and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him.<br /><br />Without giving any more of the plot away, let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has.<br /><br />Available in several formats, and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years, I definitely recommend this movie highly.  Five stars.

review/text: I should have read the book by now!  That's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version--the only movie version I've seen so far.  The cast is okay, though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating.  The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively, and I totally understand Dantes' (sp?) desire for revenge, although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all.

All this in a movie without nudity, sex or bad language. There is violence, but not in the excessive, graphic way we have come to expect from Hollywood. This movie is proof positive that you don't have to have explicit sex, language or blood and guts to have a great movie! I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Monte Cristo in 2 Hour Film?
review/text: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an over-1200-page voluminous novel. How could this super-long drama be fit into two hours? This film did that misson-impossible task. Compared with French TV-series starring Gerald Depardieu as the Count of Monte Cristo, first half of the story is well depicted, while the latter part is too brief. There is no Valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother, no Haydee, former Turk princess. And the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original story's deliberate revenge plan. But the relief is that Albert's role is spared and is given a huge part in this drama.<br /><br />Verdict: Monte Cristo for Young Adults<br />Rating: 70 out of 100. For shorter adaptation it is good.<br />Recommended for: Historical action movie fans and Three Musketeers appreciators.

review/text: I am not a movie fan.  I find it difficult to sit and watch a story for 2 hours (and nearly impossible to 'suspend disbelief').  I will not pretend to write a clinical analysis of movie-making.  I will simply say I have seen this movie twice (and plan to see it again, nearly unheard of in my case) and both times was fully enveloped in this fascinating, beautifully told story.  That editing and departure from the novel occurred in some points is no surprise (just 2 hours), but the essence of the story remains, the victory of good over evil.  Tremendous movie.

review/text: We must allow James Caviezel to be very good at being lashed- I believe, in fact, it was that aspect of this very performance that landed him the role of Jesus in Passion of the Christ. Besides that, he makes a pretty face, along with Guy Pearce, although somehow Pearce seems ESPECIALLY short in this film. Anyways, the acting is so-so, Caviezel plays Dantes as a whiny little brat, Guy Pearce acts like an evil gremlin, and the end ends happily as hollywood must, tho it makes the story more lame. The one reason to watch: Michael Wincott is excellent and deliciously evil as the prison warden for the Chateau D'if

review/text: I hate to give this film three stars. Or, rather, I hate that a film based on the book of the same title is worthy of only three stars. In most cases, I do my best to separate my opinions about a piece of literature, on one hand, and a film based on that literature, on the other. And there's no question that this film adequately and entertainingly captures the tale of revenge. What it lacks is the intricacy of Dumas's work, which really captures the meticulous planning and plotting that go into the protagonist's desire for vengeance. I cannot fault the film too much, as the level of detail required might have made this 2 hr. film much, much longer, which can be a fault, unto itself. I do recommend this movie, and for those who find it compelling, I give a far greater recommendation to the book.

review/text: This is a well done movie of my favourite story to date.  There's some time spent in France and then it's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now.  Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one.  This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see.  Boy has girl, boy has a friend, boy has his dreams come true... boy doing there... who me Tarzan?<br /><br />While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day.<br /><br />Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing.<br />The sets are over the top.  There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms.

In addition, the young man that played Jim's son must be his brother, cousin,etc in real life because he looks just like him.<br />The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying.

review/text: This is a great movie.  That many people don't know about.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce do great acting.  I think after Guy Pearce's performance, I won't like him if I ever meet him in real life.  He makes his character so dis likable.  Which is the point!

review/summary: A MOVIE THAT MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE BOOK!!
review/text: this movie is incredible. very captivating from beginning to end. sensational movie, very well done, and played out. truly stands up to the book, which was beautifully written. a bit of difference, but came out well enough to be a success. the count of monte cristo has so much in it. a young man, innocent, trusting, and in love losses it all in a second because of his suppose friends jelousy. all is taken and all hope seems lost, until he meets a friend, meanwhile his anger and vengance grow. he returns to a whole different world. his only thought is revenge, but so many twists and turns he doesn't even expect what happens to happen. this has innocence, betrayel, cruelty, hardship, vengance, love, and friendship all in one. beautiful story, a hard era, and excellent film. the actors were superb. jim caviezel, a wonderful actor. there's just something about him that makes him very interesting to watch. those eyes just draw you in and his talent, makes him great. he was spectacular in this film. guy pearce, shined his on his own behalf. did it so well that you actually hated him in this movie. all of the actors were great, made it so dramatic, it was believable. nicely done.

review/summary: An unexpected treat
review/text: The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years. I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try. However, both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel. He's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous, yet calculated revenge. I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the "bigger" names. Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie! In my opinion, it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far.

review/summary: &quot;you must look into that storm&quot;
review/text: Based on the Dumas story, this fabulous adventure about a naive, illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance, is well written with wit and intelligence, and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film.<br />The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular, though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky.<br />The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch, and adds a lot to the film.<p>The cast:<br />Jim Caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the Dantes/Count character; believable both as the innocent Edmund and the worldly Count of Monte Cristo, with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant style.<br />Richard Harris as the priest who mentor Dantes is marvelous; wily and wise, it's a perfect part for Harris, and he makes the most of it.<br />Other standout performances come from Guy Peerce as Fernand, Michael Wincott as Armand Dorelac, the Warden of d'If, and most of all, Luis Guzman as a very funny Jacopo.<p>This is terrific family viewing, free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years. This film will feed your brain, delight your eyes, and raise your heartbeat a little with its fast-paced exploits about &quot;kings and pawns, emperors and fools&quot;.

review/summary: Excellent - if you don't want to watch Count of Monte Cristo.
review/text: Yes, it is called Count of Monte Cristo, but let's just say that the story bears little resemblance to the literature. Yes, Edmond Dantes is wrongly imprisoned and meets someone there that helps him get out and rain misfortunes down on those who were responsible for his time in the Chateau d'If. That's pretty much where the similarities end. The methods of revenge in the movie are much less imaginative, basically consisting of him telling them he is Dantes and then killing them. These replace Dumas' genius methods - economic ruin, mental insanity, suicide, etc.<br /><br />However, if you don't want to commit to reading a 1500 page book, and can't devise a way to see the play adaptation, you will never know the differences, and this is a good movie. Just take it on it's own merits rather than on the book's.

review/text: This is one of our favorite movies.  We seldom like to see a movie more than twice.  However, this movie was so entertaining (as well as it contained excellent drama, acting, and a well developed plot), that we have viewed it numerous times.  My Teenage kids as well as my younger boys enjoyed the movie.  I did have to re-explain some moral issues & contradictions concerning the implied premarital sex and adultery.  We used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool. It was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to God and still be exciting.  We are going to read the book this summer, and We don't expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same.  They are two different expressions.

review/summary: Amazing film - but with a couple of minor glitches
review/text: I'll admit, I've not read the original source novel on which this is based (the only thing by Dumas I have read, is the classic 'Musketeers'); life is too short to read every great novel, try as one might - but having seen this film, I am determined to seek out the text.<br /><br /> Judging the film on its own terms, I found this immensely satisfying, and though quite long (131 min), it does not drag for a second. The story itself is really quite something, and no matter how many films you have seen, or books you have read, you will be absolutely bowled over (as George Bernard Shaw was) by the breadth, depth, simplicity and universality of it.<br /><br /> There are some minor faults with the film; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted (eg. Guy Pearce, an Australian who has mastered a range of accents, seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain: Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in 'Gangs of New York'). There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion, no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with 'Barry Lyndon' (Kubrick), this is still a riveting, assured adaptation.<br /><br /> These are very minor quibbles, and I would put this in with some of my favourite films, along with 'Captain Blood' (Errol Flynn), 'Koyanisquaatsi', 'New Cinema Paradiso' and 'Celebration' (aka Festen). Generally, the script is absolutely top notch, full of little throw-away quips and putdowns. The cast is absolutely stunning, especially James Calaziel, absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger. Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate.<br /><br /> Very highly recommended, for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock.

review/summary: a nice adaptation of Dumas's clasic novel
review/text: A film by Kevin Reynolds<p>This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas's classic novel "The Count of Monte Cristo".  From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it, but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it, I was willing to give it a chance.  Good thing, because this is a pretty good movie.  <p>The story, if you are not familiar with the source material, follows Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel).  Dantes, in the film, is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pierce) trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying.  The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled, and while they get help, Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal, and innocent, letter to a friend.  Dantes agrees.  Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter, though we do see his fianc&eacute; Mercedes Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk) and a little bit of Mondego's jealousy.  Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason.  That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all.  The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years.  <p>This is where the movie truly begins.  Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed (we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes), and he wants his revenge, though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison.  While in prison, Dantes meets Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), a man who is digging a tunnel (slowly, inch by inch) to escape.  Faria trains Dantes in the sword, teaches him how to read, science, literature, politics, and how to be a noble.  He also tells Dantes of a treasure, the treasure of Monte Cristo, that may or may not exist.  <p>We wouldn't have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge, so I'm not spoiling anything by revealing that.  Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo (Luis Guzman).  Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge.  <p>The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit, but this film is good enough, and slick enough, and entertaining enough, that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel, especially not a 1000 page novel.  With the amount of time allotted this film, "The Count of Monte Cristo" succeeds at being an entertaining film.

review/summary: Great...until the ending
review/text: I read the 'Monte Cristo' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it, so I was really pumped up to see it on screen. First off, the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film. BUT,I have to take points off for the ending. Whenever a book is made into a movie, the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually. My issue was not just that the ending was changed, it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book! It was totally ridiculous! It was exactly what you would expect to happen, even though it was totally unrealistic. That's why I gave it only three stars. If you're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience, it's a wonderful film. I suggest that you read the book first, see the movie, and judge for yourself. Or if you've already seen the film, go read the book anyway and see what you missed.

review/text: Most of the older style movies really turn me off, but not this one. I really enjoyed it. Too many of the &quot;old&quot; ones try too hard to be dramatic -- kinda like high school actors who have to talk too loud and be too flamboyant. This movie was a pleasant surprise. The actors are really good.<p>The plot is good and keeps you in your seat. Some of the things are a little predictable, but it is hard not to want to make sure that your hopes come true. You can feel yourself cringe and want to shout &quot;don't do this&quot; or &quot;don't do that&quot; or &quot;get'em&quot;.<p>The cinematography is very good and appropriate. There are not some of the anachronisms of many other film interpretations.<p>If you watch one &quot;old style&quot; movie per year, this one should be the one you watch this year.

Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count, and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy.<br />The cenimatography was beautiful, and while it was long, you love every minute of it. There are some well done action sequences (with quickened framework that adds to the tension) and the adaptation from the novel (while forced to leave a lot out, obviously...the book is insanely long!)is far better than most works of this sort. It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore (the same as Mask Of Zorro, in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out, so if you're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere) and it's well worth your while!

review/summary: Count on revenge, and then some.
review/text: After attending the release of "The Count of Monte Cristo," a friend made the remark that he believed the movie could benefit from additional fight sequences. Immediately my mind shot back to last year's "The Musketeer," also based (rather loosely, I might add) on another of Alexandre Dumas' famous classics. In that film, character development, story, and tone were sacrificed for the sake of creating yet another movie in which a choreographer of Chinese descent was allowed to make an impression on action aficionados by dazzling them with techniques reminiscent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." <p>What a relief that this latest adaptation of a Dumas novel strays from the usual clich&eacute;s and redundancy of bringing a classic work of literature to the screen, coming out as a sturdy, well-guided costume drama that combines action, intensity, passion, and most importantly, revenge. With a script that keeps much of the novel's intricacies intact, a cast befitting of their roles, and a director who keeps things interesting at all times, this is one swashbuckling adventure that pleases in all fields. <p>The story centers around Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel), a sailor from a middle class upbringing in the town of Marseilles. He has a friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), whose father is a wealthy aristocrat; despite his rich lifestyle, Mondego still harbors a slight jealousy for Dantes, who has just been promoted to captain of his vessel, allowing him the opportunity to marry his longtime love, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Overcome by envy, Mondego concocts a vicious plan with the equally jealous first mate of Dantes' boat that lands a wrongfully accused Dantes in the Chateau d'If for more than a decade.<p>During his years of imprisonment, Dantes' resolve is strengthened by brutal beatings, and by his friendship with fellow prisoner Faria (Richard Harris), who teaches Dantes to read and write, the articulate moves of swordplay, and offers him the location of a long-lost treasure that would give him the means to exact his revenge on those who have wronged him. Faria's death provides Dantes the method of escape he needs, and once out, he begins his quest. <p>The second half of the movie takes the movie to new heights of interest, as Dantes makes his big entrance in Paris as the Count of Monte Cristo, bent on exacting his revenge on Mondego, now married to a repressed, sullen Mercedes, and on Villefort, the police chief who played a role in his wrongful incarceration. Anyone familiar with revenge plots is well aware that this is a dish best served cold, and many will delight in the cooly calculated revelations and confrontations that arise as Dantes's master plan begins to unfold. <p>Accompanying this feeling of satisfaction is the movie's wondrous appearance and execution. The look and feel of the film drips with the quality of the swashbuckling adventures of yesteryear, with its themes of vengeance and nobility, it's glorious costumes and set design, and a final showdown that provides a slam-bang finish complete with suspense and fist-clenching thrills. Reynolds, and screenwriter Jay Wolpert, have realized the novel for the screen in a manner that is pleasing to the eye and the mind, keeping in touch with everything that has immortalized Dumas' work without reworking key moments to make room for modern artistic influences.<p>If this weren't enough to please popcorn audiences and literary buffs, the cast is completely remarkable. Jim Caviezel plays Dantes with the conviction of a man wrongfully accused; by the time he escapes prison, we are all for him and his brilliantly conceived plan. His chemistry with leading lady Dagmara Dominczyk is a welcome slice of old-fashioned romance, while his scenes with Guy Pearce provide a nice contrast of nobility and jealousy, which Pearce perfects in his performance as Mondego. Also worthy of noting are the appearances of Richard Harris and Lius Guzman, who provide humorous touches throughout. <p>More than anything else, this latest big-screen version of "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a wonderful popcorn adventure replete with everything you could possibly ask for in a film of this sort. Overall, it remains faithful enough to its source, and keeps us enlightened and entertained throughout its well-acted, well-directed, well-executed duration. Count on revenge, and then some.

review/summary: A surprisingly fresh and superb adventure film
review/text: In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available.  I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work.  WRONG!  This superbly made film of the Dumas' novel is excellent and gripping on every level.  The quality of the film, shot in Ireland and Malta, is visually stunning, the story remains true to the original, and the cast is outstanding.  James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role, aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce, the veteran Richard Harris, the here venomous James Frain, a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman, and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk.  The movie is beautifully paced, the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport, and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well.  This is a beautiful period piece, finely photographed and scored and edited and directed.  For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually, treat yourself to an evening with The Count!

review/summary: Not the Story, but Enjoyable Nontheless
review/text: If you have never discovered the wonderful world of Alexandre Dumas, I urge you to run, not walk to the local library or bookstore and obtain a copy of "Le Comte de Monte Christo." I also recommend reading the unabridged version of this classic tale about a man who takes revenge on his enemies. One thing is certain: do not attempt to take the lazy way out by watching this adaptation of Dumas's novel. Two hours will never be enough time to adequately express the majestic beauty of this novel written by a phenomenal storyteller. Having said that, I enjoyed immensely this version of the story starring Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and Richard Harris. Period pieces are often fun to watch, and this one is no exception. With a few problematic exceptions, "The Count of Monte Christo" is an entertaining film.<p>The tale, if you are not familiar with it, focuses on a French sailor named Edmond Dantes. On a trading trip back to Marseilles, Dantes had the misfortune to stop at the island of Elba, the home of the exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. With his captain dead, Dantes arrives in port and is promptly promoted to become the new captain. This step up in status angers several people around Dantes, specifically Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego. The three conspire to have Edmond arrested on charges of treason and thrown into a political prison called the Chateau D'If. Dantes spends years suffering in solitary confinement, although he eventually meets an elderly prisoner named Faria who educates him while they plan their escape. Moreover, this prisoner tells Edmond about a fabulous treasure that could be his for the taking. Eventually, Dantes escapes and embarks on a series of adventures that finds him returning to seek revenge against his enemies under the name "Le Comte de Monte Christo."<p>This very short description of Dumas's novel obviously leaves out much of the plot. It also highlights the inherent difficulties in translating "The Count of Monte Christo" into a two-hour film. There is just too much detail, characters, and sub-plots in the novel to work with. The revenge plots Dantes formulates against his enemies alone are of such length and complexity that it would take hours to encapsulate them on the silver screen. Throw in the sub-plot of the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa (who does appear in the film), which is of immense importance in the novel, and it is impossible to adequately convey the full majesty of this classic on celluloid. Fortunately, this film manages to entertain while retaining key elements of the written story.<p>The first part of the movie hews closely to the novel with a few notable exceptions. The film begins with Edmond and his friend Mondego landing on Elba, where they have a shoot out with British security forces before personally meeting the deposed emperor. Back in Marseilles, we meet Mercedes, Dantes girlfriend and a character who plays a big role in the written story. The filmmakers do insert a warden for Chateau D'If, played by actor Michael Wincott, who does not appear in the book. If you are familiar with Wincott, you will remember his voice and his presence. He makes a great addition here and has the best lines in the film. <p>By the time Dantes returns to society as the Count, the film diverges wildly from the story. The revenge Edmond seeks here is too pat and too easily resolved. In the book, his vengeance is intricately planned and executed slowly over many, many pages. By shortening this sequence, the filmmakers sacrifice the suspense of the novel to time constraints and a waning attention span common in today's moviegoers. To be fair, the movie never tries to be a literal interpretation of the book (or so says screenwriter Jay Wolpert in an interview on the disc). In some ways, deviating from the book does make the story more compelling. The sword fights are great fun to watch, especially the final showdown between Dantes and Mondego. The scene where Dantes provides a way out for Villefort and then pulls back at the last second is a nice touch as well. Overall, although I think more elements of the book should have been kept in the story, the movie succeeds.<p>Many extras on the disc make this well worth picking up. There is a short documentary about Alexandre Dumas, a location documentary, four deleted scenes with commentary, a film commentary from director Kevin Reynolds, a detailed explanation on how the sword fights were shot and choreographed, and an interview with writer Jay Wolpert. The picture quality and sound is top notch. I recall that this film disappeared from the theaters quickly, perhaps due to an aversion for period pieces or competition from one of those effects laden clunkers they foist on us every few months. I found "The Count of Monte Christo" entertaining and technically well done, and would certainly view it again.

review/summary: A spirited adventure.
review/text: This most recent adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel isn't going to please all the fans, particularly those who demand rigorous adherence to the source material (I never did understand such people's way of thinking; a movie is never bad just because it strays from the source) but it most certainly will please moviegoers in the mood for a period piece adventure, and as such a film, The Count of Monte Cristo never fails to entertain for every bit of its running time. <p>Jim Caviezel stars as Edmond Dantes, a rather poor and uneducated man who has a life that his rich friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) envies. Dantes has just been promoted to captain of his ship after he and his crew returned from a brief, unanticipated stop in Elba, where Napoleon had given Dantes a letter to give to a "friend." Mondego is particularly jealous that Dantes' fiancee is Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), their childhood friend who has grown into an utterly beautiful woman. <p>Mondego sets out to destroy Dantes life by telling French officials of the letter, which leads to Dantes' arrest. He is banished in a prison located on an island rather far from the mainland. As the years pass, another prisoner, Faria (Richard Harris), actually tunnels his way into Dantes cell. With his help, Faria believes they can dig to the outer wall, and in return, he will teach Dantes how to read, write, and fight with a sword. As soon as he makes his escape, Dantes plans his vengeance against those who betrayed him.<p>There's actually a LOT more plot than what I've stated, which probably already sounds hefty, but there are a lot of things I'd rather not give away. While not without some flaws, The Count of Monte Cristo is rousing entertainment and is probably the best period piece adventure in recent years (personally, I found it more enjoyable than The Patriot, Rob Roy, and The Last of the Mohicans). <p>The film's first seventy minutes represent marvelous entertainment, consistently gaining momentum with every scene that goes by as we grow more and more compelled by the story. The film stumbles only slightly in the third act, when Dantes eventually encounters all those who destroyed his life so many years ago, and sets in motion a plan for his own vengeance. It's in this lengthy segment that a few moments drag (but only a few) and some scenes feel a little hard to swallow (that Pearce's Mondego wouldn't recognize Dantes). The climax feels a little silly, in that seemingly all the lead characters pop out from nowhere to either fight or reveal long-held secrets. <p>But thankfully, such flaws are only mild and hardly detrimental. This is a well-acted, well-written, and surprisingly well-directed tale of revenge. As Dantes, Caviezel excels, making a believable transformation from a kind-hearted, innocent man to one whose heart has been hardened through so many years. Guy Pearce chews the scenery quite well as Mondego; he seems to be having a great time playing the greedy antagonist. It's nice to see that Pearce, who usually plays likable characters (as in L.A. Confidential and The Time Machine), is up to the task of giving us a villain to hiss at. <p>The other performances aren't quite as vital, though Richard Harris is good as Faria, and Luis Guzman is often hilarious as Dantes' right-hand man (the scene where Guzman tells Dantes how to handle the massive amounts of gold they just found is the biggest laugh I've had all year). Dagmara Dominczyk is pretty decent, though her acting is mostly overshadowed by her beauty, a back-handed compliment, I suppose.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo actually doesn't feature that much in the way of adrenaline-pumping action. Despite all the claims this is a swashbuckler, there are only three swordfights (and one knifefight), and each of these scenes last no longer than maybe two minutes. But the appeal of this film isn't in the action, it's watching a plot that unfolds with little twists and turns that, though often expected, engaged me because I cared about the situation and the fate of the characters.<p>There was obviously a lot of work put into the way this film looks. The cinematography is gorgeous and the sets are magnificent, with splendor I have rarely seen rendered so well in period pieces. The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who may yet have a career again after his critical disaster, Waterworld (which actually wasn't half-bad). Highly recommended, The Count of Monte Cristo is great fun all the way.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****

review/summary: The Count reigns down revenge
review/text: Not since Mask Of Zorro have we had an old fashioned revenge movie that played on classic cinema rather than tendency of movies today to be loud and bloody. I was fortunate to see this movie with a sneak preview audience. <p>James Caviezel is fantastic in the role of the Count. He is very believeable as a simple, humble man in the beginning and then the torn, angry, revenge seeking Count later on. The movie has many similar elements to the aforementioned Mask Of Zorro, but has enough of its own identity for you to note the similarities, but not be distracted by them. The beautiful actress Dagmara Domincyzk plays the love interest. There are many closeups of her face and she is stunningly beautiful and convincing. Guy Pearce is a more than able bad guy, successfully creating a character that you come to despise thoroughly by the end. <p>The audience that I viewed this with absolutely loved it. There are sprinkles of light comedic lines throughout the film and the audience was delighted with them all. The scenes where the Count is exacting his revenge registered the loudest response from the audience, as many were very vocal in their approval of the revenge being dished out.<p>It had been a while since I viewed a movie where the audience broke into a loud ovation at the end. This one received such an ovation and I concur.

review/summary: James Caviezel leads the way in a solid MONTE CRISTO
review/text: Alexandre Dumas' classic adventure novel of revenge and romance, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO has been endlessly made and remade in various films and TV series.  It's no wonder as the book's themes of betrayal and payback are timeless.  Kevin Reynolds directs a solid and full blooded version of this classic that features a star-making turn by James Caviezel in the title role.  Caviezel never hits a false note in his role of Edmond Dantes, the sailor sent to prison on trumped-charges and who eventually escapes to seek his revenge on the 3 men who conspired against him.  Caviezel easily handles both the innocence of the young Dantes and the bitter cynicism of his vengeful alter-ego. Richard Harris, who is making a cottage-industry of playing quirky supporting roles, provides warmth and humor as the Abbe' Faria, the fellow prisoner who mentors Dantes. Dagmara Domincyzk is lovely as Mercedes, Edmond's fiancee.  However, Guy Pearce, who plays Dantes' romantic rival and former friend is a little too over-the-top with his mincing and sneering portrayal.  At one point, I began thinking he needed a top hat, handlebar mustache and cape to complete the picture.<br />  Filmed on location in opulent locations in Malta and Ireland, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a feast for the eyes.  At one point, the Count makes a grand entrance in a hot-air balloon that clearly illustrates his power and mystery.<br />  The screenplay is a solid enough adapation of the rather long novel, although it does throw in a couple twists that were not in the original.  After Dantes appears in his Count identity, the pace of the film really takes off as plotlines are shortened and tightened. The action scenes are also top-notch.<br />  THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is an entertaining and fun swashbucklng type of flick that they just don't make any more. As such, it is easily the best film of this genre since THE MASK OF ZORRO which, in an ironic twist, also used elements of Dumas' novel. I definitely would recommend this film to adventure lovers and romantics everywhere.

review/summary: A Good Film-But Not the True "Count"
review/text: "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas is one of the great adventure novels of all time, and one would think that it would be the perfect story for an adventure/supense/period film.  Indeed, Kevin Reynold's version is the latest in a long line (the Hallmark televised version may be the best).  Sadly, none of them have done the written work justice.  True, the novel is a complex and detailed work that would require a rather special treatment on the screen. Reynold's version is a good movie, but honestly it is not "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Far too much dramatic license has been taken here in changing the story, the characters and the ending.  Significant characters were left out, parts of the story are not even aluded to, and some things were added to create a "hollywood" ending (no, the book ends much differently than this film...and it is far more satisfying).  This film is nicely photographed and produced and is largely well acted (except for the portrayl of Napoleon which does not work...oddly enough Napoleon is never actually "seen" in the novel, he is always off-stage, so to speak).  Enjoy this film for what it is, then treat yourself and pick up a copy of the novel.

review/summary: BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE
review/text: Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something:  Todays moviegoers want mass market drivel.  This is art.  But at the same time it's an exciting, action-packed, plot AND character driven story during which any viewer with a heart and a soul will be on the edge of his or her seat.  JIM CAVAZIEL, if there is justice in this world, will become a HUGE A-list leading man as a result of his BRILLIANT performance. No other actor out there could have played the Count in this movie; he was made for this, his role of a lifetime, and he deserves an OSCAR FOR IT.  Guy Pearce, so sexy and sympathetic in his previous roles, is so believable as a villain in this movie, that one walks out of the theatre despising his fictional self - sorry Guy this just means that you are a GREAT ACTOR - and big things are waiting for him as well - all actors in this movie are extremely talented and are irreplaceable.<br />PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE, ONE AND ALL - ITS OSCAR CALIBER,CLASSIC STUFF**DO NOT BE DISCONCERTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THE STORY - IT'S A NEW, MODERN, ORIGINAL TWIST - IT'S EVEN GOT SOME COMEDY - A MUST - SEE! AND I'VE SEEN EM ALL...I WILL PAY TO SEE IT AGAIN.  AS ABOVE, AN AUDIENCE FULL OF MANY JADED PROFESSIONAL MOVIE CRITICS GAVE IT A STANDING OVATION AT CLOSING CREDITS...

review/summary: Book Nazis need to chill
review/text: I have read the (unabridged) Count of Monte Christo book at least 4 times and can quote many of the scenes and dialogue. However I am not a literalist when it comes to Hollywood, because movies are not a literary medium. The best we can hope is that Hollywood captures the essence of the book, which I believe the makers of the Count of Monte Christo have done - and done very well.  While I agree that it is not a faithful retelling of Dumas' original, it is a fine film that captures the heart of Dumas' message: Vengeance is, (and should be) the Lord's. <p>Ultimately, Dumas' novel was about the ravages of revenge, both to the avenger and to his victims. Director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert's celluloid rendition captures that message in a way that is both entertaining and beautiful. Unlike many Hollywood films these days, this one has charm and heart, which allowed me (an avid movie buff) to overlook its occasional imperfections. <p>Jim Caviezal plays the tortured Count with aplomb. His metamorphosis from guileless youth into the brooding, devilish Count is convincing. No small feat considering young and old Dant&egrave;s are polar opposites. <p>Guy Pearce plays the treacherous libertine, Mondego, with a light, foppish touch, making the character all the more frightening. His lines are the best in the film, vicious and manipulative, but delivered with sardonic self-composure.  <p>Richard Harris was the right choice for the Abb&eacute; Faria. During Dant&egrave;s' bleak imprisonment, Harris lightens the screen with his earnest optimism and sharp wit. He is more animated than in his recent role as Dumbledore in Harry Potter, even fencing with Caviezal, despite his advanced age. <p>Dagmara Dominczyk is lovely as Mercedes, but of course lacks the vapid self-immolation of the character in the novel. Hollywood loves tidy endings so she is reunited with Dant&egrave;s while the Persian princess, Haidee, (Dant&egrave;s' real paramour at the end of the novel) is not in the film.  Still, Dominczyk's elegant grace is winning, despite the weepy dialogue she is sapped with. She and Caviezal are what movie stars should look like. <p>Luis Guzm&aacute;n is fun as the Count's dutiful sidekick, Jacopo. Not surprisingly, he is the film's comic relief and acts as a bridge between our generation and Napoleonic France. His lines are more modern slang than classical prose, but it works, especially with Guzm&aacute;n's East L.A. lilt. <p>Reynold's and Wolpert had no easy task - adapting one of the world's favorite stories to the Big Screen.  Of course, the novel is a much more complex and philosophical work than the film, and that is to be expected. A true adaptation would likely be 4-5 hours long. And, yes, they have taken liberties with the book - the ending especially. Still, the movie stands on its own as a stirring and inspiring tale of treachery, romance, revenge, and repentance. It is one of my favorite movies ever, and that's saying something, since I hate almost everything. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Fantastic Swashbuckling Tail
review/text: This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo. It doesn't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others. It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes. A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit. He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If.(thats not how you spell it but it's close enough for me) It's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature, economics, and swordplay. Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail.<p>This is a great story of revenge. Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes. He does a great job. He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he's rich. He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character. I'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future.<p>Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego. I was first impressed with Pearce in L.A. Confidential. It's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again. He plays a great bad guy. You can't stand his character and that's because Pearce plays him so good.<p>This is an awesome tail of revenge. If your a diehard Dumas fan you won't like this. I'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you. However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you. It's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies: To Be Entertained. You'll like this one.
